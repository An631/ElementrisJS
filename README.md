# ElementrisJS
Tetris Attack like game based on vanilla JavaScript. Made from scratch and different from my other Unity based implementation.

To play use the keyboard arrows to move the cursor and the 's' key to swap the pieces.
The goal of the game is to match 3 or more colors to make the blocks dissapear.

** The game is still in development and missing some key components like winning condition, rising blocks and score tracking.
